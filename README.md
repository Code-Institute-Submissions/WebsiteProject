# Dastardlys Band Website

My project is designing a website for a local band called The Dastardlys.
The website will allow the band to showcase their music and allow users to view past performances, see the upcoming events schedule, and contact the band.
 
## UX
 
This website is for managers of live band venues, organisers of events and fans.

Managers of live band venues, organisers of events can use the website to source new acts, gauge the quality, professionalism and genre.

Fans cans use this website to find out if they enjoy the band, where and when the band will be playing

- As a pub owner I want to see if this band would be suitable for my pub by viewing videos in the gallery to see what music they play and how well they play.

- As an event host I want to hire the band so I will use the contact me page to get in touch.

- As a potential fan I want to watch videos to see if I would enjoy the music so I will view the gallery.

- As a fan of the band I want to find out where they are playing next so I will go to the events page.

    - The project uses **Favicon Generator** to generate favicons for multiple devices.

## Testing

Manual User Testing was conducted and found that scrolling didn't work on iframes and scrolling also didn't hide the dropdown

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment
